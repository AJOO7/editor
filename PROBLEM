WHEN I WAS BUILDING THIS I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF WEB RTC ,PEER JS SO I JUST STARTED WITH THE EDITOR PART WHICH WAS EASY AS I HAD TO IMPLEMENT ONLY THE SOCKET PART WHICH WAS SUCCESFULL
THEN I HAD TO IMPLEMENT THE REAL TIME COMMUNICATION WITH THAT SO I TRIED WEBRTC FIRST AND AFTER LEARNING MANY THINGS SUCH AS ITS ARCHITECTURE I WAS UNABLE TO USE IT PRACTICALLY THEN I STA
STARTED LOOKING ONLINE AND I FOUND A POST THAT PEER JS MAKE THE TAKS WHICH I WANNA MAKE A LOT EASIER SO READ ABOUT PEER JS AND WAS SUCCESFULL TO RUN ONE SIDED CODE OF THE HOST BUT 
MY CLIENT SIDE CODE WAS NOT RUNNING EVEN ON RUNNING A SEPERATE SERVER MANUALLY FOR THE  PEERJS THEN I SEARCHED MORE AND COULD NOT FIND ANY SOLUTION TO THAT EVEN GAVE A ISSUE ON THE PEER JS 
ON GIT HUB BUT I FOUND THAT SOMEONE RECOMMENDED THAT IT IS NOT WORKING ON THE LOCAL MACHINE BUT ON HEROKU IT WAS FINE SO SEARCHED ABOUT HEROKU AS I ONLY HEASRD ITS NAME AND THEN WATCHED 
SOME TUTORIALS ABOUT IT AND GOT COMFORTABLE ABOUY IT AND DEPLOYED MY PROJECT ON THE ONE OF THE 5 FREE SPACE AND TO ENSURE THAT I DO NOT MESS IT I EVEN MADE ONE MORE MACHINE RUN THE SAME PROJECT 
WITH DIFF NAME  NOW MY WEBRTC PART WAS WORKING AND NOW I HAD TO COMBINE BOTH THE PART SO ICREATED 2 SCRIPT FILE AND 2 CONFIG FILE AND GAVE 2 DIFF PERT TO THEM BUT ONLY ONE WAS WORKING
SO SEARCHED ONCE AGAIN BUT COULD NOT FIND ANY THING SO I JUST THOUGHT OF COMBINIG THEM BOTH SO I COMBINED THE 2 SCRIPT FILE INTO ONE BUT NOW MY CODE WAS RUNNING BUT STILL CLIENT PART WAS
NOT WORKING SO ICOMBINED THE SOCKET FILES ASWELL AND NOW MY BOTH PART WAS WORKING TOGETER AND THEN I IMPLEMENTED ALL THE ROUTER PART AND ADDED THE DIFF SEPERTAE ROOM GENERATION
